Theme: ***Lights Out***

Based on the theme I am going to try to make an HTML5 canvas/javascript game,

Utalizing sprites and a 2d games design, I think I am going to create a game about "ridding the world of darkness"

Plants need light, when you bring light into a new ground new plant life grows. its about traveling around and removing hte darkness to make more plants and light.
