"Planting of tomato plants"


Theme: ***Lights Out***

Coded in ~48 hours, 

Small 2D free moving game with hardly any game mechanics.

This was to test out some sprite gameplay over the weekend. It was a success in that I learned a lot and fun, although next time more planning will be had.

Most of the end game mechanics did not get implemented due to lack of planning and the tight deadline.

The theme was going to be dark shadows would come every 30 seconds to destroy your plants. You plant by day, and defend at night. The game goes on until you have no plants left as it gets progressivly harder.

This was the first game jam I participated in, it was fun.
