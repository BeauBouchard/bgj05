Theme: ***Lights Out***

Coded in ~48 hours, 

Small 2D free moving game with hardly any game mechanics.


This was to test out some sprite gameplay over the weekend. It was a success and fun, although next time more planning will be had.

Most of the end game mechanics did not get implemented due to lack of planning and the tight deadline.

Special Thanks for the Background music:
